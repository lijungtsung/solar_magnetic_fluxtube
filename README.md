# Solar magnetic fluxtube

## In this repository, I show the numerical method for calculating the magnetic flux structures undergoing magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium with the ambient gas. The numercial method I follow can be found in Steiner, Pneuman, and Stenflo 1986 (A&A 170, 126)<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986A%26A...170..126S/abstract>

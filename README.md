# Solar magnetic fluxtube

This repository contains numerical methods and results for calculating solar-surface magnetic flux structures undergoing magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium with the ambient gas. The numerical methods implemented follow the approach described by Steiner, Pneuman, and Stenflo (1986).

## Contents
- **'run1_network.ipynb'**: Provides numerical results for finite-difference calculations on a 65Ã—65 mesh grid.

- **'run2_Br.py'** and **'run2_Bz.py'**: Perform linear interpolation of the radial (Br) and axial (Bz) components of the magnetic field between grid points.

- **'run3_B_continuum.ipynb'**: Demonstrates the use of a continuum magnetic field function.

## Methodology
